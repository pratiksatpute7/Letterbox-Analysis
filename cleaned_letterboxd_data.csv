Perfect color palette, absolutely hilarious, perfectly directed satire that is deliriously 90s and strangely comforting to me. The kind of movie so quickly endearing to me that I texted people to talk about it/recommend it only 20 minutes in. Everyone's so good in it (RuPaul! Holy shit!) and there are so many surprisingly tender and sweet little things that go almost underacknowledged, despite being the basis for entire seasons of TV shows that try to exist as Queer Life 101 for straights. Magnificent. Luv u Jamie Babbit. :)",10,2183,Comedy
